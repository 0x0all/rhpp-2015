Code examples from the book *R High Performance Computing* by Aloysius Lim and William Tjhi (Packt Publishing)

The code is organised by chapter, and files are named in the sequence they appear in the book. They have been tested on R 3.1.1, which was current at the time of writing. They were tested on Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, and where possible, Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and Windows 8.

While most of the code should work on all operating systems, some R packages or dependencies may not. Comments in the code indicate portions which may not work on certain operating systems.
